                Recommender systems aim to predict users' interests and recommend product items that quite likely are
                interesting for them. A recommender system applies algorithms to suggest items to online users when they
                visit a website or view an online product. Data required for recommender systems stems from explicit user
                ratings after watching a movie or listening to a song, from implicit search engine queries and purchase
                histories, or from other knowledge about the users/items themselves. Sites like Spotify, YouTube or
                Netflix use that data in order to suggest playlists, so-called Daily mixes, or to make video
                recommendations, respectively.

                Companies using recommender systems focus on increasing sales as a result of very personalized offers
                and an enhanced customer experience. Recommendations typically aim at speeding up searches and on making
                it easier for users to access content theyâ€™re interested in, and surprise them with offers they would have never
                searched for.
