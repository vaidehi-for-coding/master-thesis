                You will be interacting with 2 news recommender systems.
                <ol>
                    <li>You will be presented with a set of news headlines with short descriptions, links to the
                    respective articles (if you're interested in reading further), and a like button.</li>
                    <li>You will go through the list and choose articles you like by double-clicking on the like
                    button presented beside the article.</li>
                    <li>You are free to like any number of articles from the list.</li>
                    <li>Now click <em>ONCE</em> on the "Get Recommendations" button on the bottom right of the page.
                        Give the new page a few seconds to load.</li>
                    <li>You will be now presented with 10 articles based on your previous choices.</li>
                    <li>Continue interacting with the system and try to observe what is going on.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p align="justify">
                At the end of your interaction with both systems, you will have to fill out a small survey and answer
                questions based on your observations.
